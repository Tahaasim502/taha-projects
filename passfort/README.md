## ✨ Why I Built This

As someone stepping into Python and Cybersecurity, I wanted a simple yet practical project to apply:
- `if-else` logic  
- `while` loops  
- `any()` with list comprehensions  
- `string.punctuation`  
- `dictionaries` for clean feedback

It’s one of my first Python security tools and part of my learning journey.
