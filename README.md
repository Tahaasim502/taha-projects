# Tahas-Project

Welcome to **tahas-project**, a collection of programming projects and challenges implemented in C++ that showcase my skills in structured programming, data handling, and problem-solving. Each project is organized into its own folder with a dedicated README to explain its purpose, features, and usage.

## Contents

This repository includes the following projects (each in its own subfolder):

1. **Cricket game simulator** — A program that mimics basic match mechanics, including overs, runs, wickets, and player turns.
2. **Rock, paper, scissors** —  A fun and interactive Rock-Paper-Scissors game in C++ where you challenge the computer and instantly see who wins each round!
3. **Travel Expense Tracker** — A razor-sharp C++ expense tracker that automates business travel reimbursements down to the penny—because no one should overpay for a 6 a.m. airport coffee.
4. **Trip Expense Calculator** - Track every penny of your business trip with this smart C++ expense calculator — from parking to meals, it’s got you covered!
5. **BoxOffice++** - A sleek C++ console app that transforms seat booking into a real-time, interactive auditorium experience.
6. **Tic Tac Toe C++** - A classic 2-player grid showdown with smart input handling, random turns, and real-time win detection!
7. **Rock, Paper, Scissors C++** - Challenge the computer with randomized moves, input checks, and endless replay fun in this classic console showdown!
8. **taskcli** - A beginner- python friendly command-line To-Do app in Python that helps you manage tasks efficiently right from your terminal.
9. **Passfort** -  A sleek Python CLI tool that instantly checks and guides you to create strong, secure passwords with real-time feedback!
