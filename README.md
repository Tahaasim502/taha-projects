# Tahas-Project

Welcome to **tahas-project**, a collection of programming projects and challenges implemented in C++ that showcase my skills in structured programming, data handling, and problem-solving. Each project is organized into its own folder with a dedicated README to explain its purpose, features, and usage.

---

## Contents

This repository includes the following projects (each in its own subfolder):

1. **Cricket game simulator** — A program that mimics basic match mechanics, including overs, runs, wickets, and player turns.
2. **Rock, paper, scissors** —  A fun and interactive Rock-Paper-Scissors game in C++ where you challenge the computer and instantly see who wins each round!
3. **Travel Expense Tracker** — A razor-sharp C++ expense tracker that automates business travel reimbursements down to the penny—because no one should overpay for a 6 a.m. airport coffee.  

> *And more... Each project folder contains a detailed README describing the program, features, how to compile and run it.*

## Getting Started

- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Navigate into any project folder.
- Follow the instructions in that project's README to build and run the program.
- Each program is written in C++ and can be compiled using standard C++ compilers such as `g++`.

## Why This Portfolio?

- Demonstrates practical use of C++ structures, unions, arrays, dynamic memory, and input validation.
- Focuses on real-world inspired problems, including data management, simulations, and user interaction.
- Perfect for showcasing foundational programming skills in preparation for internships or job interviews.
